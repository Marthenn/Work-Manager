# ~/.config/systemd/user/work-manager.service
#
# This service file enables the automatic "stop work" command on user session logout/shutdown.
# It's a "oneshot" service that does nothing on start, but executes a command on stop.

[Unit]
Description=Work Manager Automatic Shutdown Stopper

[Service]
# This service type is for scripts that do one job and then exit.
Type=oneshot
# This is key. It tells systemd that the service should be considered "active"
# even after its start command has completed.
RemainAfterExit=true

# The command to run when the service starts. We just use /bin/true because
# we don't need to do anything when we run `work.py start`.
ExecStart=/bin/true

# The command to run when the service is stopped, which happens during
# system shutdown or when we manually run `work.py stop`.
#
# !!! IMPORTANT !!!
# You MUST replace '/home/your_user/bin/work.py' with the actual, absolute
# path to where you saved the work.py script.
ExecStop=/usr/bin/python3 ~/.local/bin/work.py stop

[Install]
# This ensures the service is part of the normal user session target,
# so it will be properly started and stopped with the user's session.
WantedBy=default.target
